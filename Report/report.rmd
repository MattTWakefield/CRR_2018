# Leading Causes of Structure Fires for `r FD_NAME`:

\par One of the simplest ways of assessing the magnitude of the fire problem in the fire department's response area is to draw comparisons with the State of Tennessee as a whole. Below is a comparison of the fire department to the state in three key areas:

* Percentage of population at high risk: The percentage of the population the fire department serves that is considered high risk. High risk factors include income, education, and home values.

* Structure Fires per one thousand: This is the average amount of structure fires the occur per year, averaged over the past five years.

* Structure Fire Death Frequency: For the fire department, this is the frequency that a fatality has occurred over the past five years. For the state comparison, we used the anticipated frequency of fatalities, assuming the fire department had the same fatality rate that Tennessee has. \par

\vspace{10mm}

```{r FireRates, echo=FALSE}

kable(comp.df, format = "latex", booktabs = FALSE)%>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = TRUE)%>%
  column_spec(1, width = "6cm")%>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)


```

\vspace{10mm}

Below, the top causes are listed for the department for the past five years. Not all fires are equal and as such, the cause associated with the most frequent fires are not always the most deadly or costly.

##A Snapshot of High Risk in the Department's Community:
These three demographic risk factors; age, household income and education were all found to be highly related to the chance of a fire incident occurring. Below is a table that shows the department's demographics compared to the state as a whole. Those demographic characteristics highlighted in red indicate that the protected population's risk is **higher** compared to the state.

## Percentage of Housing Stock Built Before 1980:

Though only 50% of Tennessee's housing stock was built before 1980, 83% of fire deaths occur in these homes. As fire service professionals, it is important to realize how many of these high risk structures are in the community.

# Mitigation Strategies
## Addressing the Leading Causes of Fire:

When looking to eliminate fire-related injuries and fatalities, we should start with the leading causes of fire within each community. Here are the leading causes of fire for `r FD_NAME`.

1. `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[1,"New_Cause_Description"]),"",top5.fd.ms[1,"New_Cause_Description"])`

    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[1,"Message1"]),"",top5.fd.ms[1,"Message1"])`
    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[1,"Message2"]),"",top5.fd.ms[1,"Message2"])`
    
2. `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[2,"New_Cause_Description"]),"",top5.fd.ms[2,"New_Cause_Description"])`

    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[2,"Message1"]),"",top5.fd.ms[2,"Message1"])`
    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[2,"Message2"]),"",top5.fd.ms[2,"Message2"])`
    
3. `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[3,"New_Cause_Description"]),"",top5.fd.ms[3,"New_Cause_Description"])`

    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[3,"Message1"]),"",top5.fd.ms[3,"Message1"])`
    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[3,"Message2"]),"",top5.fd.ms[3,"Message2"])`
    
4. `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[4,"New_Cause_Description"]),"",top5.fd.ms[4,"New_Cause_Description"])`

    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[4,"Message1"]),"",top5.fd.ms[4,"Message1"])`
    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[4,"Message2"]),"",top5.fd.ms[4,"Message2"])`
    
5. `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[5,"New_Cause_Description"]),"",top5.fd.ms[5,"New_Cause_Description"])`

    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[5,"Message1"]),"",top5.fd.ms[5,"Message1"])`
    * `r ifelse(is.na(top5.fd.ms[5,"Message2"]),"",top5.fd.ms[5,"Message2"])`


## Contributing Factors

The contributing factors below have been identified as rising trends in the state of Tennessee. The SFMO's Monthly Fire Prevention Education Plan has useful information on how to mitigate and identify these factors in the community.

# Fire Fatality Report
While fire fatalities are not an indicator of a department's quality, knowing when and why they are occurring is an effective tool for preventing future travesties from occurring. Below is a brief overview of fire fatalities in `r FD_NAME`'s jurisdiction since 2009.

## Fire Fatalities by Year:

# Response Times

  footnote(general = RTS.avg)


```


NFPA 1710 states that career fire departments should be responding to fires within 4 minutes or less and that turnout time should take no longer than 1 minute and 20 seconds 90% of the time. The metric of 5 minutes and 20 seconds assumes that all incidents had a 1 minute and 20 second turnout time.

NFPA 1720 states that volunteer fire departments protecting an area comprised of more than 1000 people per square mile should respond to structure fires in 9 minutes or less 90% of the time, volunteer departments protecting 500-1000 people per square mile should respond in 10 minutes or less 80% of the time, and volunteer departments protecting less than 500 people per square mile should respond to structure fires in 14 minutes or less 80% of the time.

Our response time data is strictly based on NFIRS reporting and does not validate NFPA 1710/1720 compliance.

This metric does not contain any incidents other than fires (100 series) where a valid and complete NFIRS record was submitted.
